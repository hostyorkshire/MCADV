## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please:
1. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/hostyorkshire/MCADV/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Review the [troubleshooting guides](guides/)
3. Gather relevant information (logs, hardware specs, configuration)

**When reporting a bug, include:**

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your hardware setup (Pi model, radio, etc.)
- Software versions (Python, Ollama, MCADV commit)
- Relevant log snippets from `logs/`
- MeshCore radio configuration

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:
- Check if the feature already exists or is planned
- Clearly describe the feature and its use case
- Explain how it benefits the project
- Consider implementation complexity

## 🔧 Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MCADV.git
cd MCADV
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
./setup_venv.sh

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Development Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Linters
```bash
# Run all linters at once
./run_linters.sh

# Or check individual linters
flake8 .
black --check .
isort --check-only .
pylint *.py
mypy .
bandit -r .
```

See [docs/LINTING.md](docs/LINTING.md) for detailed linting documentation.

### 5. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./run_all_tests.sh

# Or use the interactive menu
./run_tests_menu.sh
```

## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Maximum line length: 120 characters

### Code Quality
We use multiple linters to ensure code quality:
- **Black** - Automated code formatting
- **isort** - Import statement organization
- **Flake8** - PEP 8 compliance checking
- **Pylint** - Comprehensive code analysis (target: ≥ 9.0/10)
- **MyPy** - Type checking and hints
- **Bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning

**Before submitting a PR:**
```bash
# Run all linters
./run_linters.sh

# Auto-fix formatting issues
black .
isort .
```

Configuration files:
- `.flake8` - Flake8 settings
- `.pylintrc` - Pylint settings
- `pyproject.toml` - Black, isort, mypy, bandit settings
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration

See [docs/LINTING.md](docs/LINTING.md) for comprehensive linting documentation.

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Add integration tests for major features
- Test on actual hardware when possible

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issues in commits (e.g., "Fixes #123")

### 3. Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Run all tests
./run_all_tests.sh

# Test on hardware if possible
./run_adventure_bot.sh --help
```

### 4. Update Documentation
