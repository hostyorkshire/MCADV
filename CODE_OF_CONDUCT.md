# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We will respect everyone’s opinions and contributions while maintaining a welcoming and inclusive community.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive and unacceptable behavior by participants include:

### Positive Behavior
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- The trolling, insulting, or degrading of any community member
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@hostyorkshire.com](mailto:contact@hostyorkshire.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

**1. Correction:**  A private, written notice to the offending party, providing guidance on acceptable behavior.

**2. Warning:** A public notice to the group indicating that the member has violated the Code of Conduct and should cease this behavior.

**3. Temporary Ban:** A member found to have violated the Code of Conduct may be banned temporarily from the community until the issue is resolved.

**4. Permanent Ban:** A member may be permanently banned from the community if they violate the Code of Conduct repeatedly or in a particularly egregious manner.
