                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p>Hear ye, hear ye! In the forgotten corners of the digital realm, where no central authority holds dominion, a new form of storytelling has emerged from the mists...</p>
                    
                    <p>The CYOA Bot (MCADV) is a beacon of imagination carried across the invisible threads of mesh networks—those resilient webs of connection that need no lord, no server, no decentralised keep. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure companion that travels through the aether via LoRa radio waves, bringing tales of wonder to those who dare to venture forth.</p>

                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p><strong>Decentralised by Nature:</strong> Like the wandering bards of old, the CYOA Bot needs no throne room or castle tower. It lives on the mesh, a network of peers where each node is equal, each voice carries the same weight.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Stories Without Bounds:</strong> Every adventurer crafts their own path through realms of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. Your choices shape your journey—no two tales are the same.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Community Over Empire:</strong> This is not a service controlled by distant overlords. It runs on your own devices, in your own communities, powered by the collective spirit of exploration and wonder.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Freedom to Roam:</strong> Whether you dwell in remote hamlets or bustling market squares, the mesh reaches where traditional networks fear to tread. No internet required, no surveillance watching, just pure adventure.</p>

                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p>Adventurers send forth their commands via radio whispers across the mesh. The AI storyteller—residing on simple devices like the humble Raspberry Pi—conjures forth scenarios, presenting choices at each crossroad.</p>
                    
                    <p>Will you brave the dark forest? Negotiate with the dragon? Explore the abandoned space station? The story bends to your will, branching infinitely like the roots of the World Tree.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each decision ripples through the narrative, creating a unique tale woven just for you, transmitted back through the mesh to your device, wherever you may roam.</p>

                    <p>In an age where stories are locked behind paywalls and algorithms decide what you see, the CYOA Bot stands as a reminder of simpler, freer times. It is:</p>

                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p>This project is for those who remember when technology was about discovery and creation, not consumption and control. It's for radio enthusiasts who understand that sometimes the best network is the one you build yourself. It's for storytellers who know that the best adventures are the ones you create together.</p>
                    
                    <p>The CYOA Bot is a love letter to the early days of computing—when systems were meant to empower, not exploit. When communities built tools for joy, not profit. When the only limit was imagination.</p>

                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure</strong> (also known as <strong>Create Your Own Adventure</strong>) is a beloved children's gamebook series written in second person, where the reader assumes the protagonist's role and thereby makes choices determining the plot.</p>
                    
                    <p>This CYOA Bot brings that same spirit of interactive storytelling to the mesh network—allowing adventurers to craft their own tales through the power of AI and community-driven technology.</p>
