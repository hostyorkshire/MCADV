                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p>Hear ye, hear ye! In the forgotten corners of the digital realm, where no central authority holds dominion, a new form of storytelling has emerged from the mists...</p>
                    
                    <p>The CYOA Bot (MCADV) is a beacon of imagination carried across the invisible threads of mesh networks—those resilient webs of connection that need no centralized infrastructure. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure companion that travels through the aether via LoRa radio waves, bringing tales of wonder to those who dare to venture forth.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">✧ The Ancient Ethos ✧</h2>
                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p><strong>Decentralised by Nature:</strong> Like the wandering bards of old, the CYOA Bot needs no throne room or castle tower. It lives on the mesh, a network of peers where each node is equal, each voice carries the same weight.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Collaborative Stories:</strong> Every adventurer on the #adventures channel participates in the same shared tale. Your choices shape the collective journey—the story evolves through community decisions, making each adventure a unique group experience.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Community Over Empire:</strong> This is not a service controlled by distant overlords. It runs on your own devices, in your own communities, powered by the collective spirit of exploration and wonder. The collaborative nature of the storytelling mirrors the communal ethos of the mesh itself.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Freedom to Roam:</strong> Whether you dwell in remote hamlets or bustling market squares, the mesh reaches where traditional networks fear to tread. No internet required, no surveillance watching, just pure collaborative adventure.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">✧ How the Magic Unfolds ✧</h2>
                <div class="scroll-text">
                    <p>Adventurers send forth their commands via radio whispers across the mesh. The AI storyteller—residing on simple devices like the humble Raspberry Pi—conjures forth scenarios, presenting choices at each crossroad.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>But hark! This is no solitary quest.</strong> All who join the #adventures channel participate in the same shared tale. When one adventurer chooses to brave the dark forest or negotiate with the dragon, the entire fellowship follows that path. The story bends to the collective will of the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Will you explore the abandoned space station together? Decide as one to face the ancient evil? Each decision ripples through the narrative for all participants, creating a unique collaborative tale woven by the entire mesh community. The adventure resets automatically after 24 hours of runtime, whereupon a new tale may begin for all.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is storytelling as it was meant to be: communal, interactive, and full of surprises as different voices guide the narrative forward.</p>

                    <p>This project is for those who remember when technology was about discovery and creation, not consumption and control. It's for radio enthusiasts who understand that sometimes the best network is the one you build yourself. It's for storytellers who know that the best adventures are the ones you create together.</p>
                    
                    <p>The CYOA Bot is a love letter to the early days of computing—when systems were meant to empower, not exploit. When communities built tools for joy, not profit. When the only limit was imagination.</p>

                    <p>This mystical companion works through the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) stored locally using Ollama—requiring no internet access whatsoever. The network depends solely on the meshcore network, making it truly free from the constraints of the outside world.

                    <p><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure</strong> (also known as <strong>Create Your Own Adventure</strong>) is a beloved children's gamebook series written in second person, where the reader assumes the protagonist's role and thereby makes choices determining the plot.</p>
                    
                    <p>This CYOA Bot brings that same spirit of interactive storytelling to the mesh network—allowing adventurers to craft their own tales through the power of AI and community-driven technology.</p>
