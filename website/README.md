# MCADV Website

This is the static website for the MCADV project, styled as a medieval bulletin board.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main webpage with project philosophy and ethos
- `style.css` - Medieval-themed dark styling

## Deployment

This website is deployed to cPanel using cPanel's built-in Git Version Control feature. Pushing to the `main` branch on GitHub triggers an automatic pull to the live server.

For setup and configuration instructions, see [docs/CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md).  
For a quick reference checklist, see [docs/QUICK_START_CPANEL.md](../docs/QUICK_START_CPANEL.md).

## Design Philosophy

The website uses:
- Dark medieval/bulletin board aesthetic
- Gothic and medieval fonts (MedievalSharp, Cinzel, UnifrakturMaguntia)
- Parchment-like textures and borders
- Non-technical, philosophy-focused content
- Emphasis on decentralization, community, and open source values

## Local Testing

To view locally, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

## License

Same as the main MCADV project.
